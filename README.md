Assessment of Anomalous Temperature & Salinity Events in the Gulf of Maine

Abstract: 
Marine heatwaves (MHW), analogous to atmospheric heatwaves, are prolonged events of anomalously high sea surface temperatures and can be detrimental to marine ecosystems and local economies. They can be driven by ocean processes, such as changes in ocean circulation impacting the local composition of different water masses, as well as atmospheric forcing associated with increased heat flux into the ocean. Ocean stratification plays an important role modulating the response of the upper ocean to surface forcing. In this project, MHW characteristics in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) are investigated and whether MHWs can be amplified through surface freshwater events that increase stratification. The Gulf of Maine is experiencing rapid warming in recent decades, likely connected to a northward Gulf Stream shift and North Atlantic circulation changes. Here, we use a 22-year mooring time series from the Jordan Basin to characterize MHWs, Marine Cold Spells, and extreme anomalous salinity events. Our results show that high temperature and high salinity anomalies, and vice versa, frequently co-occur at mid-depths, likely influenced by the advection of offshore water masses into the GoM. We also find that surface freshwater signals may potentially have an effect on MHW conditions and MHW depth. Characterizing anomalous events in recent decades allows for better informed management decisions and predictions of ocean conditions.
